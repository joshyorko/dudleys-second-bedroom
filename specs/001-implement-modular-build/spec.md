## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: When a build module fails during execution, what should happen to the partial build artifacts? ‚Üí A: Automatically delete all artifacts to ensure clean state
- Q: When validation checks (syntax, configuration) fail before the build starts, should the build system allow forcing the build to proceed anyway? ‚Üí A: Allow only for non-critical warnings, block errors
- Q: When the build system detects that a base image dependency (Universal Blue/Bluefin-DX) is unavailable or fails to pull, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Fall back to cached/last-known-good base image
- Q: For build observability (monitoring what's happening during builds), what level of logging detail should be the default? ‚Üí A: Standard - Module start/end + errors + warnings
- Q: When module dependencies create a dependency chain (Module A requires Module B's output), should the build system support parallel execution of independent modules? ‚Üí A: Yes, auto-detect and parallelize independent modules

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a **system maintainer**, I need the build system to be organized into clear, modular components so that I can:
- Understand what each build step does without reading monolithic scripts
- Make changes to specific functionality without affecting unrelated components
- Reduce build times through effective caching strategies
- Troubleshoot build failures by isolating which component failed
- Maintain the system long-term with minimal technical debt

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new package needs to be added, **When** the maintainer updates the package configuration, **Then** the change is isolated to a single, clearly-named configuration file and does not require editing multiple build scripts

2. **Given** the container image needs to be rebuilt, **When** only wallpaper files have changed, **Then** the build system reuses cached layers for all other components, reducing build time from 30+ minutes to under 5 minutes

3. **Given** a build failure occurs, **When** examining the build logs, **Then** the specific module (e.g., "desktop customizations" or "developer tools") that failed is immediately identifiable without parsing monolithic script output

4. **Given** the maintainer needs to modify desktop environment settings, **When** locating the relevant code, **Then** all related functionality is grouped in a single, appropriately-named directory (e.g., "desktop/") rather than scattered across multiple files

5. **Given** a new contributor needs to understand the build process, **When** reviewing the repository structure, **Then** the purpose of each directory and major component is self-evident from its name and organization

6. **Given** system files need to be cleaned up to reduce image size, **When** the cleanup process runs, **Then** it automatically removes all unnecessary artifacts without requiring manual identification

7. **Given** the build system configuration changes, **When** validating the changes locally, **Then** the maintainer can run a single command to check syntax, validate configurations, and lint all scripts before committing

8. **Given** a build is running, **When** the maintainer reviews the build logs, **Then** they can see when each module starts and completes, along with any errors or warnings, without being overwhelmed by verbose command output

### Edge Cases
- What happens when **a module depends on another module's output**? The build system must enforce proper execution order and clearly document dependencies, while automatically detecting and parallelizing independent modules to optimize build time
- How does the system handle **partial build failures** in one module? The build must fail fast with clear error messages indicating which module failed and why, and automatically delete all partial build artifacts to ensure a clean state for the next build attempt
- What happens when **cache invalidation is needed**? The maintainer must be able to force a clean rebuild with a simple command
- How does the system handle **different build variants** (e.g., with/without certain features)? The architecture must support conditional inclusion of modules without code duplication
- What happens when **the base image (Universal Blue/Bluefin-DX) is unavailable**? The build system must fall back to the cached/last-known-good base image with a warning notification to the maintainer

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Build Organization
- **FR-001**: The build system MUST organize Build Modules into logical categories (shared utilities, desktop customizations, developer tools, user-level configurations)
- **FR-002**: The build system MUST separate reusable utility functions from specific feature implementations
- **FR-003**: Each Build Module MUST be independently testable without requiring a full container build
- **FR-004**: The build system MUST clearly document execution order and dependencies between Build Modules, AND automatically detect independent modules to execute them in parallel for optimized build time

#### Configuration Management
- **FR-005**: Package definitions MUST be centralized in a single, structured configuration file
- **FR-006**: System file deployments MUST be organized by their target location in the final system
- **FR-007**: Configuration changes MUST be validatable before being incorporated into a build

#### Build Performance
- **FR-008**: The build system MUST support layer caching to avoid rebuilding unchanged components
- **FR-009**: The build system MUST complete incremental builds in under 10 minutes for: (a) single Build Module changes, (b) wallpaper-only changes (< 5 min), or (c) single package additions to packages.json
- **FR-010**: The build system MUST support cache invalidation when dependencies change
- **FR-011**: The build system MUST minimize the size of the final container image through aggressive cleanup, AND fall back to cached/last-known-good base image when the primary base image is unavailable, with clear warning notification to the maintainer

#### Quality Assurance
- **FR-012**: The build system MUST validate all configuration files before starting the build process
- **FR-013**: The build system MUST validate shell script syntax before execution
- **FR-014**: Build failures MUST produce clear, actionable error messages indicating which Build Module failed
- **FR-015**: The build system MUST provide a single command to run all validation checks locally
- **FR-016**: The build system MUST distinguish between critical validation errors (syntax errors, security issues, missing required fields) which block builds regardless of flags, and non-critical warnings (style issues, unused configurations) which allow builds to proceed with explicit override
- **FR-017**: The build system MUST log at standard detail level by default: Build Module start/end events, all errors, and all warnings (excluding verbose command-by-command output)

#### Maintainability
- **FR-018**: Each Build Module MUST include inline documentation describing its purpose, dependencies, and usage
- **FR-019**: The project structure MUST be self-documenting through directory and file naming conventions
- **FR-020**: Changes to the build system MUST not break compatibility with the Universal Blue/Bluefin-DX base image
- **FR-021**: The build system MUST support rollback to previous configurations if a build fails
- **FR-022**: The build system MUST automatically delete all partial build artifacts (incomplete container layers, temporary files in /tmp, downloaded packages in /var/cache) when a Build Module fails to ensure clean state for subsequent builds

#### Automation
- **FR-023**: The build system MUST be automatable through a single command for each major operation (build, test, clean, validate)
- **FR-024**: The build system MUST support integration with CI/CD pipelines without requiring manual intervention
- **FR-025**: The build system MUST generate consistent, reproducible builds given the same input configuration

### Key Entities

- **Build Module**: A self-contained executable script with header metadata, responsible for a specific aspect of the system (e.g., desktop environment, developer tools). Each Build Module has clear inputs, outputs, and dependencies documented in its header.

- **Build Stage**: A distinct phase in the container image creation process (e.g., file preparation, base customizations, cleanup). Stages can be cached independently and reused across builds.

- **Package Configuration**: A structured definition of all software packages to be installed, organized by category and including version specifications where needed.

- **System File Deployment**: Static configuration files and assets that must be copied into specific locations in the final system image.

- **Build Validation**: Automated checks that verify configuration syntax, script correctness, and dependency availability before and during the build process.

- **Build Cache**: Reusable artifacts from previous builds that can be leveraged to speed up subsequent builds when inputs haven't changed.

- **Cleanup Specification**: Rules and procedures for removing unnecessary files, caches, and artifacts to minimize the final image size without affecting functionality.

2. **Maintainability**: A new contributor (familiar with bash and containers, but new to this project) can locate and modify a specific feature's build code in under 5 minutes
3. **Error Resolution**: Build failures provide specific Build Module names and error locations in logs
4. **Code Organization**: No Build Module exceeds 200 lines of code; all functionality is modularized
5. **Validation Coverage**: 100% of configuration files and Build Modules pass automated validation before builds
6. **Cache Hit Rate**: At least 80% of build layers are reused when only 1-2 files change
7. **Image Size**: Final container image size is reduced by at least 10% through improved cleanup
