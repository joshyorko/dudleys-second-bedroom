# Specification Quality Checklist: Automatic Content-Based Versioning for User Hooks

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **PASS** - The specification maintains proper abstraction:
- No specific technologies mentioned in requirements (bash, SHA256 mentioned only in Assumptions/Dependencies)
- Focus on "what" needs to happen, not "how" to implement
- Requirements written from user/system perspective, not developer perspective
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - Requirements are complete and well-defined:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all ambiguities resolved
- Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., "MUST compute SHA256 hashes" can be verified by testing hash output)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (e.g., "within 5 seconds", "under 50KB", "zero manual updates")
- Success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes, not implementation internals
- 5 detailed acceptance scenarios cover primary and edge-case flows
- 7 edge cases identified covering failure modes, missing data, and boundary conditions
- Scope explicitly defines what's in/out of scope (prevents scope creep)
- Dependencies and assumptions clearly documented

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - Feature is ready for planning:
- All 20 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios
- Three prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) provide clear implementation order
- Success criteria are measurable without knowing implementation (e.g., "hooks re-execute only when dependencies change" is verifiable through black-box testing)
- No technology leakage into spec (bash/SHA256/jq mentioned only in appropriate technical context sections)

## Notes

- Specification successfully avoids implementation details while providing clear, testable requirements
- Assumptions section appropriately documents technical dependencies without prescribing implementation
- The "Out of Scope" section effectively manages expectations for future enhancements
- All checklist items pass validation ✅
- **Status**: READY for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
