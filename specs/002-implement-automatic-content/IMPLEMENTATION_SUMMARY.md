# Implementation Summary: Automatic Content-Based Versioning

**Feature**: 002-implement-automatic-content  
**Date**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: MVP Complete (User Story 1)  
**Branch**: `002-implement-automatic-content`

## Summary

Successfully implemented automatic content-based versioning for user hooks, eliminating manual version management. The system computes SHA256 hashes of hook scripts and their dependencies at build time, replacing placeholders with computed versions. Hooks now only re-execute when their content actually changes.

## What Was Implemented

### Phase 1-2: Foundation (Complete ✓)

**Utility Functions**:
- `build_files/shared/utils/content-versioning.sh` - Hash computation and placeholder replacement
- `build_files/shared/utils/manifest-builder.sh` - Build manifest generation and validation
- Comprehensive test suites with 18 passing tests

**Test Coverage**:
- `tests/test-content-versioning.sh` - 8 tests for hash computation and placeholder replacement
- `tests/test-manifest-generation.sh` - 10 tests for manifest building and validation
- All tests passing ✓

### Phase 3: User Story 1 - Automatic Hook Re-execution (Complete ✓)

**Orchestration**:
- `build_files/shared/utils/generate-manifest.sh` - Computes hashes for all hooks and generates manifest

**Modified Hooks** (now use content-based versioning):
- `build_files/user-hooks/10-wallpaper-enforcement.sh` - Wallpaper setup hook
- `build_files/user-hooks/20-vscode-extensions.sh` - VS Code extensions hook
- `build_files/user-hooks/99-first-boot-welcome.sh` - Welcome message hook

**Build Integration**:
- Modified `Containerfile` to:
  1. Generate build manifest with content hashes
  2. Replace `__CONTENT_VERSION__` placeholders in hooks
  3. Store manifest at `/etc/dudley/build-manifest.json`

**Integration Tests**:
- `tests/test-hook-integration.sh` - 8 end-to-end tests
- All integration tests passing ✓

## How It Works

### Build Time
1. **Hash Computation**: `generate-manifest.sh` computes 8-character SHA256 hashes of each hook and its dependencies
2. **Manifest Generation**: Creates JSON manifest at `/etc/dudley/build-manifest.json` with all version hashes
3. **Placeholder Replacement**: Replaces `__CONTENT_VERSION__` in hook scripts with computed hashes

### Runtime
1. **Version Check**: Hooks call `version-script` with computed hash
2. **Skip/Run Decision**: If hash matches previous run, skip; otherwise execute
3. **Automatic Recording**: version-script records new version after successful completion

## Example Manifest

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "build": {
    "date": "2025-10-10T14:55:15Z",
    "image": "ghcr.io/joshyorko/dudleys-second-bedroom:latest",
    "base": "ghcr.io/ublue-os/bluefin-dx:40",
    "commit": "a55df81"
  },
  "hooks": {
    "wallpaper": {
      "version": "be33ee21",
      "dependencies": [
        "build_files/user-hooks/10-wallpaper-enforcement.sh",
        "custom_wallpapers/dudleys-second-bedroom-1.png",
        ...
      ]
    },
    "vscode-extensions": {
      "version": "0dfa5280",
      "dependencies": [
        "build_files/user-hooks/20-vscode-extensions.sh",
        "vscode-extensions.list"
      ]
    },
    "welcome": {
      "version": "dd776f51",
      "dependencies": [
        "build_files/user-hooks/99-first-boot-welcome.sh"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Results

### Unit Tests (18/18 Passing)
- ✓ Hash determinism (10 iterations)
- ✓ Multi-file ordering independence
- ✓ Error handling for missing files
- ✓ Placeholder replacement success
- ✓ Hash format validation
- ✓ Manifest structure validation
- ✓ Hook addition (single and multiple)
- ✓ Schema validation
- ✓ File permissions (644)
- And more...

### Integration Tests (8/8 Passing)
- ✓ All hooks contain __CONTENT_VERSION__ placeholder
- ✓ All hooks use version-script function
- ✓ All hooks source libsetup.sh
- ✓ Manifest generation produces valid JSON
- ✓ Manifest contains all hooks with valid hashes
- ✓ Manifest size < 50KB
- ✓ Hooks have fail-fast error handling
- ✓ Hooks have logging statements

## Breaking Changes

**None**. This is a backward-compatible enhancement:
- Existing hook behavior preserved (first boot always runs)
- Universal Blue version-script integration is non-breaking
- Manifest file is new (no existing file to conflict with)

## Migration Path

For other projects adopting this pattern:

1. **Copy utility scripts**:
   ```bash
   cp build_files/shared/utils/{content-versioning,manifest-builder,generate-manifest}.sh <your-project>/
   ```

2. **Modify your hooks**:
   - Add `source /usr/lib/ublue/setup-services/libsetup.sh`
   - Replace version number with `__CONTENT_VERSION__`
   - Use `version-script <hook-name> __CONTENT_VERSION__`

3. **Update Containerfile**:
   - Add manifest generation step
   - Add placeholder replacement step
   - See this project's Containerfile for example

4. **Test**:
   - Copy test scripts
   - Run tests to verify integration

## Performance Metrics

- **Hash Computation**: <1 second for all 3 hooks + dependencies
- **Manifest Generation**: <0.5 seconds total
- **Manifest Size**: <1 KB (well under 50KB limit)
- **Build Overhead**: <2 seconds total (within 5-second target)

## Success Criteria Met

From spec.md:

- ✅ **SC-001**: Zero manual version updates required
- ✅ **SC-002**: Hooks re-execute only when dependencies change
- ✅ **SC-003**: Manifest generation < 5 seconds
- ✅ **SC-008**: Build fails on missing dependencies (tested)
- ✅ **SC-009**: No regressions (existing hooks still work)
- ✅ **SC-010**: Manifest < 50KB

Remaining (for User Stories 2 & 3):
- ⏳ SC-004: Welcome display < 1 second (US2)
- ⏳ SC-005: Hash determinism (tested, need 100-build CI test)
- ⏳ SC-006: View build info on demand (US2)
- ⏳ SC-007: New hook template success (US3)

## Next Steps

The MVP (User Story 1) is complete and fully functional. Optional enhancements:

### User Story 2: Build Transparency (Priority P2)
- Enhance welcome hook to display manifest information
- Create `dudley-build-info` CLI tool
- Add metadata (extension counts, change flags)

### User Story 3: Developer Documentation (Priority P3)
- Create TEMPLATE-new-hook.sh
- Write DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md
- Enhance quickstart.md with real examples

### Polish (Phase 6)
- Create run-all-tests.sh orchestrator
- Update main README.md
- Run shellcheck on all scripts
- Document feature in project docs

## Known Limitations

1. **Metadata Optional**: Currently metadata fields are empty (planned for US2)
2. **No Change Detection**: Can't detect if hooks changed vs unchanged from previous build (planned for US2)
3. **Manual Template Usage**: No automated hook generator (planned for US3)

## Constitution Compliance

- ✅ **I. Modularity**: Separate utilities for hash computation, manifest building, orchestration
- ✅ **II. Simplicity**: Standard Unix tools (sha256sum, jq, sed)
- ✅ **III. Documentation**: All scripts have comprehensive headers
- ✅ **IV. Validation**: Test suites for all components
- ✅ **V. Immutability**: Build-time generation, runtime read-only
- ✅ **VI. Container-Native**: Integrates with Containerfile build process
- ✅ **VII. User Experience**: Transparent versioning, clear logging

## Conclusion

The automatic content-based versioning system is fully implemented and tested for the MVP use case. Hooks now automatically track content changes without manual version management. The system is extensible for future enhancements (US2 & US3) while maintaining backward compatibility.

**Status**: Ready for production use. User Story 1 complete. ✓
